Hi, I'm Konstantinos â€“ some-time bug developer, some-time car enthousiast. This repo is where I throw code at the wall to see what compiles.

Projects may or may not include:

- Half-finished experiments that made sense at 2am

- Bug collections that are starting to unionize 

- README files with more personality than the actual apps 

Warning: Some repos are held together by duct tape and hope.
